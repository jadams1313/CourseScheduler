##Overview
Course Scheduler is a GUI that simulates the scheduling process faced by American College Students.

#HowToUse
Download the project as a ZIP and open in the IDE NetBeans. This does NOT use a package manager, so it must be ran in NetBeans. 

##Data
All data must be simulated by the user. 
The user can input student, class, course, etc. data all with the GUI. This data is uploaded into a local DB Beaver RDBMS that does not leave the disk. 
Thus, any attempt to share data over the wire is beyond the scope of this project.

##Uses
This project CAN simulate what its like to schedule as an American College Student, and sample data files found given your university can be directly uploaded in NetBeans for real life simulation of scheduling. 
Note this does not confirm anything will directly map to the DB. You will likely have to manually input data given to you.
